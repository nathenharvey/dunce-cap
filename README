Dunce-Cap was born out of some very frustrating late nights working on a death march.

In short, a small group of people were rapidly coding and deploying things, and would occasionally step on each other in interesting ways.  I quickly threw something together to lock the deploy while it was running, lock the deploy if you knew something was unstable, leave reminders that get shown on a deploy, and add logging to cap so you can have some forensic evidence when things go south.

This was many years ago, when we were working on subversion, and before git solved some of these harried coordination issues for us.

Still, I find myself coming back to this occasionally.  The lock is nice.  The log file is nice.  All in all, its a useful, if raw, set of cap extensions.


install this as a plugin using the git url from github.

./script/plugin install git://github.com/bokmann/dunce-cap.git

I'll convert it to a gem sometime in the future - right now, plugins are easily loaded into cap tasks, so this works.

Dunce-cap adds logging, reminder messages, and deploy locks to your cap deploys with little to no effort on your part.

check out cap -T to see definitions of the tasks it adds.


If you want logging, add this line to the top of your deploy.rb file:

require 'vendor/plugins/dunce_cap/lib/caplogfix'

and this line at the base or in a task you want to turn logging on for:

log "log/my-logs-filename.log"


Also provides logging of some major events via the growl command line tool if you have it installed.
